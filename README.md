# The God of Transitions

There are many CSS3 sliders out there. Most of them are coded purely in CSS
just because it can be done, but none of them fully utilize the possibilities of [CSS3 transitions
](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions/). I belive we need more powerfull slider component that
*focuses on features instead of technology*, meets the standards of todays websites and doesn't
require few days of setting up and coding.

Hermes comes with:

 * configurable background an content transitions (and big transition library),
 * responsiveness (automatically adjusts it's layout to screen resolution),
 * extendability (expecially in adding new transtitions),
 * component-based approach (each feature can be enabled separately),
 * HTML/CSS programming interface (no JavaScript coding required).

## Getting the Code

Preferred way to get hermes is to use [bower](http://bower.io/).
```
bower install hermes-slider --save-dev
```

You can also clone it with [git](https://git-scm.com/).
```
git clone https://github.com/md-extensions/hermes.git`
```

Package is not published in [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).
