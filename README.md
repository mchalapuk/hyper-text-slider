# Utilizing [CSS3 transitions](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions/)

Hermes comes with:

 * configurable background an content transitions (and big transition library),
 * responsiveness (automatically adjusts it's layout to screen resolution),
 * extendability (adding new transtitions is very simple),
 * component-based approach (each feature can be enabled separately),
 * HTML/CSS programming interface (no JavaScript coding required).

Preferred way to get hermes is to use [bower](http://bower.io/).
```
bower install hermes-slider --save-dev
```

You can also clone it with [git](https://git-scm.com/).
```
