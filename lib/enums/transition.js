/**
 * Transitions add nice animations to slide changes. Typically, one transition adds animation
 * to slide's content (${link Layout.CONTENT}) or slide's background (${link Layout.BACKGROUND}),
 * or both. Custom transitions may also animate only parts of slide's content (e.g. to display
 * some parts of the slide with a delay).
 *
 * Multiple transitions MAY be added on each slide element (${link Layout.SLIDE}) in client HTML.
 * During [slider's DOM upgrade procedure](dom-upgrade.md), each slide with no transitions
 * specified receives transitions which were declared on the slider element (${link Layout.SLIDER}).
 * If there is no transition specified on the slider, ${link Transition.ZOOM_OUT_IN}
 * and ${link Transition.BG_ZOOM_IN_OUT} are used as default.
