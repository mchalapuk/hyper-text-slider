 * Each class is checked by the slider in one of two ways:
 *  1. <a href='#once' id='once'>**checked once**</a> - class name should be set
 *    in client HTML, slider will check for it only once during upgrade, adding/removing class
 *    after upgrade make no effect,
 *  2. <a href='#continuously' id='continuously'>**checked continuously**</a> -
 *    class name may be added/removed at any time, slider will check if it is set every time
 *    a decission connected with this class is made.
 *
 * There are two categories of class names:
 *  1. **functional classes** - each of which enables one feature,
 *  2. **class groups** - that adds many class names to the slider during its
 *    [upgrade](dom-upgrade.md).
